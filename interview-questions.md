# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React? 

  Your answer: Props are communication arroyos that allow information to flow downstream (one direction) from parent to child components. 

  Researched answer: Props, short for properties, are used to pass data between components in REACT. Data is assigned from the parent componenet to the child component(s) using the 'prop' attribue; using dot notation {props.name} to access and render.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: DOM is always watching and is always listening. BAsically DOM responds to user interaction. It could be a text type message or the click of a button, Regardless, you can't get anything passed DOM.

  Researched answer: DOM events are how HTML documents refister diffrent event handler elements when using Javasc. These events are paired with functions and will not execute before the function in imnvoked. 



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: I feel like I should have a better Idea of this one. This style uses methids and functions to perform tasks?? I'm not really able to tab much from the well on this one. Definitely need a better review of this one. Any information you would like to ketch-me-up with?

  Researched answer: Is what they call a pardigm of programming; operating on an 'objects' based concept, using field based data and code based procedures. It excels in code reusability, scalability, and efficiency. It has four basics; abstaction, encapsulation, and polymorphism. 



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: A float is a number with a decimal and an integer is rounded to the whole number. 

  Researched answer: Integers, aka int, are numbers without a decimal point while floats are float-pointing, which means there is a decimal present in the data. Between the two, integers are more a more precise datatype. 



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean? 

  Your answer: implicit return means it does it automatically, without 'return' or a like of it present. 

  Researched answer: In Ruby, functions are returned without a function keyword. basically, Ruby methods will return the evaluated result of the last line expression unless there is an explicit return before it. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: variables decalred in a class but that are outside constructors, methods, or blocks. They are created when pbjects are instantiated and are accessable to all constructors, methods, and/or blocks within the class.

2. PostgreSQL: AKA postgres, this is a free amnd open-source realational dataase system. It's specifically designed for SQL compliance; who did what, when, where and how? 

3. Ruby on Rails: Rails is basically Ruby on steroids. it's open sourced and and creates website using Ruby's GPPL(general purpose programming language).

4. ORM: uses object oriented paradigm to write access your database. It's like SQL but more user friendly.         querrying is easier and allows you to use the language you are already writing in. 

5. Active Record: Based on convention, vice configuration, AR is Ruby's version of JS's hybernate; providing excelllant space to create, read, update, or delete data.
